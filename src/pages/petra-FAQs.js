                    8. Is the Petra Balloon wheelchair and stroller friendly?
                  </b>
                  <br></br> The Petra Balloon is accessible for wheelchairs and
                  baby strollers. Please speak to a Ground Crew member for
                  assistance in loading and unloading the balloon gondola. The
                  wheelchair/stroller must have a braking/locking system to
                  prevent unsecured movement in flight, and this function will
                  be checked and verified by the Ground crew before boarding.
                  Wheelchairs and strollers complying with the above
                  requirements are available on-site for guests' use if needed.

                  for safety reasons.
                </li>

                  <b>11. How long is each flight experience?</b>

                  but all guests must go through a short safety briefing before
                  boarding their flight.

                  operating flight height depending on adverse weather
                  conditions.

                  the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, and other conditions
                  aggravated by flight and/or elevation change should refrain
                  from boarding the balloon. All minors under 12 years of age
                  must be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or a
                  responsible adult 18 years or older.

                  mandatory safety briefing and need to complete a boarding
                  pass, including a waiver. A Ground Crew member will collect

                    flies?
                  </b>
                  <br></br>Guests who do not wish to participate in the flight
                  experience but want to watch their family can purchase a
                  lounge access ticket on-site and enjoy a beverage while

                  <b>17. Is this the same as a hot air balloon ride?</b>
                  <br></br> No, this is a helium balloon tethered to the ground,
                  which is different from a hot air balloon. The Petra Balloon
                  is filled with non-flammable helium and is tethered to the
                  ground via a cable. The balloon will take off and land on the
                  same platform.

                  weather conditions at the time.

                  <b>19. Is the balloon affected by weather conditions?</b>
                  <br></br> The balloon operation depends on weather conditions;
                  the balloon will be grounded if there is a thunderstorm or
                  winds above 25 knots at the ride height.
